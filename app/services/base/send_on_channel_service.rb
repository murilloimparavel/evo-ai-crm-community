# To create an external channel reply service
# - Inherit this as the base class.
# - Implement `channel_class` method in your child class.
# - Implement `perform_reply` method in your child class.
# - Implement additional custom logic for your `perform_reply` method.
# - When required override the validation_methods.
# - Use Childclass.new.perform.
